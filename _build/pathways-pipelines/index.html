While districts control nearly every aspect of the recruiting and hiring process, states have authority over entry into the principal role, including&#58; </p><blockquote>Approval of principal preparation programs, and setting program and applicant standards, coursework, and on-the-job learning time.</blockquote> <blockquote>Establishment of licensure and certification rules, including initial licensure and renewals.</blockquote> <blockquote>Oversight of preparation programs, including collecting and monitoring data regarding recruitment, selection, and performance.</blockquote></div>

States should adopt a data-tracking system that enables officials to answer the following questions. <h2 class="subtitle is-6">Supply</h2><ul><li>	How many principals do districts need to hire on an annual basis, including by type of school or program (e.g., turnaround, rural, etc.)?</li><li>How many graduates does each preparation program produce annually?</li><li>How many graduates secure licenses and obtain principalships?</li></ul> <h2 class="subtitle is-6">Performance</h2><ul><li>Are graduates of preparation programs effective at raising student and educator outcomes?</li><li>Which preparation programs are most effective based on graduate performance?</li><li>Are only effective programs being renewed?</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Expand Pathways</h2><blockquote>Move from yesterday’s narrow pathways based on a one-size-fits-all approach to leadership training to expanded principal pathways that meet a broader array of needs</blockquote><ul><li>Diversify the types of training programs to meet targeted needs (e.g., rural, turnaround, and new schools) by equipping principals with specialized training.</li><li>Allow training programs to be operated by a diverse array of providers, including nonprofits, districts, and CMOs, in addition to universities.</li><li>Focus on increasing diversity among principal ranks, and allow for training of non-traditional candidates who can apply their experience to leading schools.</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Raising the Bar</h2><blockquote>Adopt statewide leadership standards and require programs to align with them</blockquote>Standards should be rigorous, research-based, and aligned with expectations for students. The National Policy Board for Education Administration and the Council of Chief State School Officers recently updated the most commonly adopted standards (formerly called ISLLC standards), available here. <a href="http://www.ccsso.org/Resources/Programs/Developing_and_Supporting_School-Ready_Leaders.html" target="_blank">2015 Professional Standards for Education Leaders</a>.</div>

Rhode Island principal preparation programs are also required to collect outcome data for graduates, and principals must demonstrate effectiveness for license renewal.<h2 class="subtitle is-6">ILLINOIS</h2>Beginning in 2010, Illinois raised its preparation program standards in order to address an oversupply of program graduates and relatively low program quality. After re-accrediting programs according to the new standards, the state has improved program quality and better aligned the supply of principal graduates with open positions.<h2 class="subtitle is-5">Model Spotlight</h2><h2 class="subtitle is-6">BRIGHT NEW LEADERS</h2>Bright New Leaders is an alternative preparation program jointly developed by the Ohio Department of Education, the Ohio Business Roundtable, and the OSU Fisher College of Business. The program recruits proven leaders from a variety of fields through a highly selective process that includes multiple interviews and a leadership development assessment. Fellows train intensively under the mentorship of an accomplished principal and an executive-level business leader and complete an accelerated MBA program. Graduates commit to a two-year placement in a high-poverty, low-performing school. <a href="http://www.brightohio.org/" target="_blank">BrightOhio.org</a><h2 class="subtitle is-6">NORTHEAST LEADERSHIP ACADEMY</h2>North Carolina’s Northeast Leadership Academy (NELA) at N.C. State University is an intensive, research-based leadership development program serving a consortium of 13 school districts. The program is specifically designed to train principals for rural high-poverty, hard-to-staff, historically low-performing schools. Program Fellows are evaluated and assessed multiple times each semester. A key requirement is the completion of a yearlong principal residency with a mentor principal and an internship project through which Fellows identify a ‘problem of practice’ at their placement school and develop a strategy to address it. <a href="http://nela2.wordpress.ncsu.edu/" target="_blank">nela2.wordpress.ncsu.edu/</a></div>

Instead, what follows are two resources that state advocates can use as the basis for model language for statutory, regulatory, or administrative policy changes. It should be noted that most states do not yet have the capacity to implement rigorous evaluation and renewal policies detailed below—thus, the model policy language is aspirational and reflects the ideal elements toward which states should move.</p><p>Models developed by the Tennessee State Board of Education and New Leaders, a national leadership development nonprofit organization, were selected because both reflect key elements of specific state policy actions that can improve leadership preparation&#58;</p><ul><li>A rigorous approval and renewal process that is open to non-university-based providers and is based on outcome measures for program and graduate performance, as well as the ability of the state to decertify programs that do not meet standards.</li><li>Requirements that programs are standards-based, establish a high bar for candidate entry and exit, and include a clinical component through which participants can demonstrate actual leadership practice.</li><li>A focus on using outcomes-based data to inform decision making.

Much of the available research mirrors general findings on improving overall educator quality and/or is limited to survey and descriptive research from a handful of reputable organizations.<h2 class="subtitle is-5">Research-Based Recommendations for Improving Principal Preparation Programs</h2><ul><li>Based on a landmark four-year study of principal preparation programs, three overarching improvement strategies emerged (<a href="http://www.edschools.org/reports_leaders.htm" target="_blank">Levine, 2005</a>)&#58;</li><ul><li>Eliminate incentives (e.g., salary scales that award raises based simply on obtaining credits and degrees) that reward completion rather than improvement in quality, thereby promoting and sustaining low-quality programs.</li><li>Enact high standards for leadership preparation programs; evaluate programs based on their effectiveness, and close low-performing programs.</li><li>Redesign curricula and degree options to make them more relevant to current needs.</li></ul><li>Despite these recommendations from 2005, subsequent studies and reports (detailed below) indicate that little has improved with respect to school leadership programs.</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Research Findings on Principal Pathways and Pipelines</h2><p>State policies regarding leadership preparation need significant improvement.</p><p>A 2013 report surveyed all 50 states and Washington, D.C., regarding principal policies and found that 1) states are not effectively using their authority to improve the supply of high-quality school leaders; and 2) in general, states lack key data on the supply and quality of school leaders (<a href="http://www.bushcenter.org/alliance-reform-education-leadership/arel-state-policy-project" target="_blank">Briggs, Cheney, Davis & Moll, 2013</a>).</p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">States not collecting and utilizing data</h2><ul><li>State principal policy is surprisingly uninformed by data. States lack basic information on principal supply and demand, including how many principals graduate from preparation programs each year, where they are placed, and whether they positively impact student achievement (<a href="http://www.crpe.org/publications/principal-concerns-leadership-data-and-strategies-states" target="_blank">Campbell and Gross, 2012</a>). In fact, 19 states were unable to report on how many principals graduate annually (<a href="http://www.bushcenter.org/alliance-reform-education-leadership/arel-state-policy-project" target="_blank">Briggs et al., 2013</a>).</li><li>States also are not tracking principal performance, and therefore are not linking it to training and preparation (<a href="http://www.bushcenter.org/alliance-reform-education-leadership/arel-state-policy-project" target="_blank">Briggs et al., 2013</a>).</li><li>Without performance data, states cannot tell which programs are graduating the strongest and weakest principals (<a href="http://www.crpe.org/publications/principal-concerns-leadership-data-and-strategies-states" target="_blank">Campbell and Gross, 2012</a>).</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Pathways are narrow and do not produce a diverse candidate pool</h2><ul><li>Principal preparation programs are not producing enough high-quality school leaders. Both urban and rural districts report difficulty finding qualified candidates (<a href="http://www.bushcenter.org/alliance-reform-education-leadership/arel-state-policy-project" target="_blank">Briggs et al., 2013</a>). </li><li>According to a 2012 survey of 40 charter management organizations (CMO) in 14 states, 61 percent reported that their efforts to scale up were hindered by the limited supply of high-quality principals (<a href="http://www.crpe.org/publications/principal-concerns-leadership-data-and-strategies-states" target="_blank">Campbell and Gross, 2012</a>).</li><li>Even though university-based providers have demonstrated a lack of rigor and practical coursework in their programs (see below) and several alternative programs have demonstrated positive outcomes, programs run by nonprofits, districts, and CMOs often are not eligible for accreditation. As of 2013, 29 states did not have any accredited non-university principal preparation programs in operation; several of these states limited accreditation of principal preparation programs to university-based providers (<a href="http://www.bushcenter.org/alliance-reform-education-leadership/arel-state-policy-project" target="_blank">Briggs et al., 2013</a>).</li><li>Diversity among school leaders does not reflect the public school population. In the 2011-12 school year, 80 percent of public school principals were white; yet white students comprised only 51 percent of public school students (<a href="http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2013/2013313.pdf" target="_blank">Bitterman, Goldring, Gray, and Broughman, 2013 and NCES</a>).</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Preparation programs are not rigorous and often lack practical experiences and training</h2><ul><li>The Alliance to Reform Education Leadership identifies seven elements of an effective, research-based principal preparation program (a) program purpose, (b) competency framework, (c) recruitment, (d) candidate selection, (e) coursework, (f) clinical leadership experience (practical/in-school training, like shadowing an experienced principal), and (g) program completion requirements. The <a href="http://www.bushcenter.org/alliance-reform-education-leadership/arel-state-policy-project" target="_blank">Briggs et al. 2013 survey of state policy</a> found that&58;</li><ul><li>In 2013, only five states reported requiring preparation programs to include all elements.</li><li>Only 11 states reported requiring clinical leadership experience as part of training.</li></ul><li>In a 2007 analysis of 56 leadership preparation program course syllabi, researchers found (<a href="https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/20061221_LearningtoLeadTCR.pdf" target="_blank">Hess and Kelly, 2007</a>)&58;</li><ul><li>Limited emphasis on accountability in the context of school management or school improvement and limited instruction on managing school improvement via data, technology, or empirical research.</li><li>Limited focus on recruiting, selecting, or hiring new teachers.</li><li>Limited focus on building leadership culture, despite widespread recognition of its importance.</li><li>Many courses included no final assessment to ensure students mastered the content.</li></ul></ul><ul><li>Principals need training on teacher retention&#58;</li><ul><li>Research shows that principals can impact teacher retention through their actions (<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~sloeb/papers/Admin and Retention 12_12_09.pdf" target="_blank">Boyd et al., 2011</a>).</li><li>In a 2012 survey by The New Teacher Project (TNTP) of 90,000 teachers in four large urban districts, only 26 percent of high-performing teachers reported that their school leader identified career opportunities for them as teacher leaders within the school and only 37 percent reported that their school leader encouraged them to teach at the same school the next year (<a href="http://tntp.org/publications/view/the-irreplaceables-understanding-the-real-retention-crisis" target="_blank">TNTP, 2012</a>).</li><li>When using retention strategies, principals are not differentiating among teachers based on classroom effectiveness or overall value to the school; instead they encourage both high-performing and low-performing teachers to keep teaching the following year at similar rates (<a href="http://tntp.org/publications/view/the-irreplaceables-understanding-the-real-retention-crisis" target="_blank">TNTP, 2012</a>).</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Preparation programs are not accountable for results</h2><p>Principal preparation programs are almost wholly unaccountable&#58; re-approvals happen without data. Instead, decisions regarding programs are mostly based on whether the program is operated by a university rather than via evaluation of program characteristics and quality, meaning most programs are automatically renewed (<a href="http://www.bushcenter.org/alliance-reform-education-leadership/arel-state-policy-project" target="_blank">Briggs et al., 2013</a>). </p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Promising Alternative Models</h2><p>Although the number of alternative programs is growing, evidence of results is still incredibly limited, indicating that far more study is needed. In fact, of 60 alternative leadership programs identified by Bellwether in a 2014 study, researcher John Chubb found evidence of results for only a handful, including KIPP, New Leaders, New York City Aspiring Principals Program, and the Urban Education Leadership Program at the University of Chicago (<a href="http://edexcellence.net/articles/building-a-better-leader-lessons-from-new-principal-leadership-development-programs" target="_blank">Chubb, 2014</a>).</p></div>
