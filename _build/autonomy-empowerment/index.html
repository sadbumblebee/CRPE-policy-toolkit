When coupled with outdated rules and technology, district procurement systems can hinder school leaders seeking to manage their schools efficiently and creatively (<a href="www.crpe.org/publications/blueprint-effective-and-adaptable-school-district-procurement" target="_blank">Maas and Lake, 2015</a>).</li> <li>While much of the problem can be attributed to district policy and practice, the underlying causes often begin at the state level. Burdensome state bidding requirements and funding constraints inhibit district flexibility to reallocate funds to take advantage of new opportunities (<a href="www.crpe.org/publications/blueprint-effective-and-adaptable-school-district-procurement" target="_blank">Maas and Lake, 2015</a>).</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Principals do not have authority to build and manage effective teams</h2><ul> <li>Authority to manage staff (the “ability to hire, promote, and dismiss”) is “the most important, yet most commonly lacking condition for principal effectiveness” (<a href="http://www.newleaders.org/newsreports/great-principals-at-scale/" target="_blank">Ikemoto, Taliaferro, Fenton, and Davis, 2014</a>).</li> <li>Lack of personnel authority is not just a perception among principals—about half of the personnel barriers they cited were real. Barriers include (<a href="http://www.crpe.org/publications/policy-barriers-school-improvement-whats-real-and-whats-imagined" target="_blank">Miller and Lee, 2014</a>)&#58;</li> <ul> <li>Collective bargaining agreements (CBA) that prohibit use of performance/incentive pay, require forced placement, use seniority as driver of decision making, and establish overly burdensome dismissal processes (CBAs themselves are a district issue, but states often stipulate which policies are required with respect to personnel).</li> <li>Required use of central hiring pools (district issue).</li> </ul> <li>New Leaders recommends that states eliminate state-level regulatory/policy barriers that constrain principals in hiring and promoting the best teachers, as well as removing ineffective teachers (<a href="http://www.newleaders.org/wp-content/uploads/2015.07.18.Untapped_PolicyRoadmap.pdf" target="_blank">New Leaders, 2015</a>).</li> <li>States can also support principals who pursue distributed leadership models by eliminating policy barriers and developing model collective bargaining language that enables teachers to observe, evaluate, and provide feedback for other teachers (<a href="http://www.newleaders.org/wp-content/uploads/GreatPrincipalsatScale_StateFederalPolicyBrief.pdf" target="_blank">New Leaders, 2014</a>).</li></ul></div>
