      <!-- <h1 class="title is-2">How to Use the School Leadership Policy Toolkit</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-3">Why a School Leadership Policy Toolkit?</h2> -->
      <p>Much of the education policy advocacy in recent years has focused on improving teacher quality. But too often, the ‘human-capital’ reform strategy has missed a key element—strengthening school leadership. Whether we’re trying to raise the bar for instruction or expand school options for parents, there’s little that can be done to successfully improve schools without strong school leaders. Yet not only have advocates tended to focus too little on this area, but state leaders have neglected it as well. Most states lack a coherent strategy for school leadership, even though it’s clearly a fundamental piece of the puzzle.</p>
      <p>Luckily, this mindset is slowly shifting as advocacy leaders and policymakers begin to focus on what makes a great principal and how to get more of them in the schools that need them most. This school leadership policy toolkit is designed to support those reform efforts.</p>
      <p>A review of the research and literature around school leadership policies reveals five key policy areas, around which this toolkit is built:</p>

      <p>The school leadership policy toolkit is intended to assist advocacy groups in sifting through leadership research to develop a strategy for making improvements in their own states. We identify clear components that states should have in place, and models and experts in the field from which advocates can learn. </p>
      <p>That’s not to say there is a defined approach that every state should take. Improving school leadership demands a multi-faceted, state-specific strategy that considers a combination of state policy, state leadership, and district practice. In some instances, a change in state policy can work well to move the needle, for example by removing statutory barriers that prevent non-traditional candidates from entering the principal pipeline. In other instances, policy reform isn’t the solution; rather, the state can provide guidance to districts and schools to help them address their long-term staffing, capacity, and programmatic needs.</p>

      <h2 id="whatsIncluded" class="subtitle is-3">What’s included in the School Leadership Policy Toolkit?</h2>
      <p>An overview of the importance of principals and how their roles and time should be structured.</p>
      <p>The five policy sections, which include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A brief review of the available research and findings you’ll need to understand the policy more fully, as well as potential barriers to reform.</li>
        <li>An advocacy piece designed to communicate to policymakers and stakeholders why they should take action. </li>
        <li>Model policy, if appropriate.</li>
        <li>A list of available resources and experts for more information.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An illustration of how each of the five policy areas work together and interact with other state-level policy reforms.</p>
      <p>A matrix detailing proposed state actions and policy recommendations for each policy area.</p>

      <h2 class="subtitle is-3">Getting Started</h2>
      <p>The lack of a coherent strategy for school leadership in most states presents an opportunity to develop a comprehensive plan that both reflects the best research and aligns to other reforms being implemented (like new teacher evaluations and turning around low-performing schools). Ideally, the state department of education leads the way on the strategy development. But in some states, the department may lack the capacity, bandwidth, or the will to take the lead. In this situation, advocacy groups and stakeholders can play a more prominent role.</p>
      <div class="columns">
        <div class="column">
          <p>Every state needs an overall strategy (or combination of strategies) for school leadership. Questions to consider include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Does the strategy articulate a clear vision for school leadership in the state?</li>
            <li>Does the strategy identify existing strengths of the state policy environment on which to build, and challenges to address? </li>
            <li>Is the strategy data-driven and informed by research?</li>
            <li>Are there clearly defined goals and metrics to measure success of the strategy?</li>
            <li>Are the roles of the state and districts clearly delineated? </li>
            <li>Are there timelines associated with achieving those goals?</li>

            <div class="message-body">
            <p>Improving school leadership should not be viewed as something that can be solved piecemeal. These materials provide an array of options that can be tailored to fit the best path forward for your particular state. </p>
            <p>But keep in mind that policies and actions are interdependent. That is, the impact of strengthening the talent pipeline will be minimal if new principals aren’t supported and the best principals aren’t retained over the long run. In order for a state to develop and deploy a strong corps of effective principals, its reforms must be coordinated and comprehensive in scope.</p>

      <h2 id="evolving" class="subtitle is-3">The Evolving Role of the Principal</h2>
      <p>Over time, the role of the principal has expanded and evolved to encompass a wide array of expectations.  Second only to teachers, principal effectiveness is the most important in-school factor that influences student achievement. Today, a principal’s role is to&#59;</p>
      <blockquote>Foster an environment in which students learn and grow and educators share responsibility for providing high-quality instruction.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>Provide overall leadership and strategic vision, manage day-to-day operations, and ensure the school has the necessary resources and supports to meet its goals.</blockquote>
      <p>Principals also lead implementation of many school-based education reforms such as new teacher evaluations or rollout of new curriculum aligned with Common Core standards, and they may be responsible for establishing new schools or turning around low-performing schools. Community and parent engagement is also an integral part of the job.</p>
      <p>Not surprisingly, there is no single mold for a great principal, nor a single list of characteristics. Being a strong school leader is all about what the principal does to impact both the school environment and the classroom to influence student outcomes.</p>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-4">The right focus on instruction</h2>
      <p>Principals have more impact when they foster a college-going school culture and a safe, orderly climate. Involvement in daily classroom instruction only marginally impacts student achievement and can negatively impact teacher morale.</p>
      <p>Success relies on a delicate balance of leadership (setting a high bar, focusing on meaningful data, clearing obstacles) and coaching (including leadership development among master teachers and trainers).</p>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Building and maintaining a strong instructional team</h2>
      <p>Some principal-led activities, like teacher coaching, evaluation, leadership development, and developing the school’s academic program, directly relate to student achievement gains.</p>
      <p>Strong principals also impact teacher retention. Teachers take their cues from the culture established by the leader; effective teachers are less likely to leave if they have faith in leadership.</p>
      <h2 class="subtitle is-4">Managing the school to meet its goals</h2>
      <p>Principal management and school success are linked&#59; principals with stronger organizational management skills (e.g., personnel, budgeting) that are successful operating within the confines of the system tend to lead schools that demonstrate greater student achievement gains. Every principal should feel empowered to make the best decisions for their school and their students.</p>

      <h2 id="needs" class="subtitle is-3">Determining Needs &amp; Strategies</h2>
      <p>Specific needs will vary by state, but generally fall into three areas: not enough principals to meet <em>demand</em>, principal <em>quality</em> needs improvement, or districts and schools struggle with <em>retaining their best principals.</em></p>
      <blockquote><p><strong>Not enough principals to meet demand:</strong> Districts should be planning ahead, not only for recruitment needs, but also for succession. Strategic planning recognizes not just the number of projected vacancies, but also the different needs among them (e.g., chronically low-performing schools need stronger leadership).</p>
      <p>States need to know whether existing pipelines are providing the requisite number and quality of leaders needed, yet principal supply should not outpace demand. Program diversity should reflect the diversity of district needs across the state, and states should utilize alternative certification routes to expand and enhance the candidate pool.</p></blockquote>
      <blockquote><strong>Principal quality needs improvement:</strong> Principal effectiveness is a good indicator of whether a school can be successful in meeting the needs of students and educators. All principals, regardless of their level of experience or performance, deserve regular reviews and feedback on performance. Development and coaching options should be tailored to meet the needs of each principal. States can expand the reach of resource investments by tracking how they’re used, creating flexibility to blend different funding streams, and linking outcomes to expenditures.</blockquote>
      <blockquote><strong>Districts and schools struggle with retaining their best principals:</strong> Successful retention efforts maintain stability in school leadership and keep the best people in place longer. States should identify and provide support to districts that struggle with retention, as well as think strategically about improving retention statewide. States should also be concerned with whether effective principals are in the places most needed and whether they are distributed equitably.</blockquote>

      <h2 id="data" class="subtitle is-3">Collecting the Right Data</h2>
      <p>By collecting the right data and aligning it to the right objectives, states can take action to address these needs. </p>
      <p>Unfortunately, collection and use of good data is more of an ideal than a practice in most states. Using the <a href="http://www.crpe.org/publications/principal-concerns-leadership-data-and-strategies-states" target="_blank">basic data categories</a> below, you can take stock of which questions your state is equipped to answer. Solving data deficits where identified should be a high priority.</p>
