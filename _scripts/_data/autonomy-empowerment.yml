    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Why should states strengthen autonomy and empower school leaders?</h2><p>The role and responsibilities of the school principal have grown more complex over the years. Principals are expected to shape the overall academic vision for their school, cultivate a culture of collaboration and excellence, and manage people, data, and processes to enable the school and its students to achieve at high levels.</p><p>Yet while it’s clear that principals feel accountable for results, they feel they are lacking the tools and authority to succeed. According to the 29th Annual MetLife Survey of the American Teacher, principals report that their authority does not match their responsibility&#58;</p><div class="columns"><div class="column is-quarter"><blockquote><strong>89%</strong></br>agree they should be accountable for everything that happens to children in their school.</blockquote></div><div class="column is-quarter"><blockquote><strong>43%</strong></br>have control over removing teachers</blockquote></div><div class="column is-quarter"><blockquote><strong>42%</strong></br>have control over curriculum and instruction</blockquote></div><div class="column is-quarter"><blockquote><strong>42%</strong></br>have control over finance decisions.</blockquote></div></div><p>As the principal role has evolved and become more demanding, states are recognizing that leaders need a wider array of tools and authority to be successful.</p>

    content: <p>In a study of northeast states, the Center on Reinventing Public Education found that <strong>New Hampshire</strong> provided the best policy climate for autonomy and innovation. Compared to their peers in other states, principals in New Hampshire face the fewest barriers to school autonomy, like learning time requirements and other restrictions on funding.</p><p><strong>California</strong> recently revised its school funding scheme by eliminating many categorical restrictions and establishing an accountability system for how funds are spent. Schools now have more funding available for special populations and greater discretion over how to utilize state base funding.</p><p>Principals in <strong>Colorado</strong> and <strong>Tennessee</strong> are empowered to hire teachers based on their fit with the school team and to make other personnel decisions based on the teacher’s performance in the classroom.</p>

    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Research findings and recommendations regarding principal autonomy &amp; empowerment</h2><p>Despite the well-established impact of school leaders on student achievement, there is limited research on how specific policies impact principal quality and availability. Much of the available research mirrors general findings on improving overall educator quality and/or is limited to survey and descriptive research from a handful of reputable organizations.</p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Principals’ effectiveness is impacted by their level of authority</h2><ul> <li>Schools improve when principals have autonomy over decision making (<a href="http://www.newleaders.org/newsreports/great-principals-at-scale/" target="_blank">Ikemoto, Taliaferro, Fenton, and Davis, 2014</a>).</li> <ul> <li>According to a 2009 Wallace Foundation study of 17 school districts, decision-making authority had positive correlation with time spent on activities associated with improving instructional practices, including promoting professional development, motivating staff, building a common school vision, and developing leadership capacity.</li> </ul> <li>Schools with autonomy to determine their needs, goals, and programs do the best job of identifying approaches to change (<a href="http://www.wallacefoundation.org/pages/1_2-shared-leadership-learning-from-leadership.aspx" target="_blank">Seashore Louis, Leithwood, Walhstrom, and Anderson, 2010</a>).</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Principals do not feel they have sufficient authority</h2><ul> <li>A large gap exists between expectations for principals and the authority they believe they have to manage their schools (<a href="https://www.metlife.com/assets/cao/foundation/MetLife-Teacher-Survey-2012.pdf" target="_blank">MetLife, 2013</a>)&#59;</li> <ul> <li>89 percent of principals agree that “a principal should be held accountable for everything that happens to the children in a school.”</li> <li>43 percent of principals say they “have a great deal of control when it comes to removing teachers.”</li> <li>42 percent of principals say they “have a great deal of control over curriculum and instruction.”</li> <li>22 percent of principals say they “have a great deal of control in making decisions about finances.”</li> </ul> <li>Changing <em>how schools are funded</em> and <em>how schools are held accountable</em> would improve funding flexibility. States could&#59;</li> <ul> <li>Hold schools accountable for measures of student performance instead of schooling inputs like seat-time requirements and mandated curricula (<a href="www.crpe.org/publications/policy-barriers-school-improvement-whats-real-and-whats-imagined" target="_blank">Miller and Lee, 2014</a>).</li> <li>Fund students instead of programs, staff positions, or school days, and judge progress based on the proportion of funding over which the principal has discretion at the school level (<a href="http://www.crpe.org/publications/policy-barriers-school-improvement-whats-real-and-whats-imagined" target="_blank">Miller and Lee, 2014</a>).</li> <li>Move away from strict adherence to funding formulas and school-level staffing mandates toward explicitly giving districts and school leaders flexibility to use innovative staffing models and better align the funding with school’s strategic priorities (<a href="http://www.newleaders.org/wp-content/uploads/GreatPrincipalsatScale_StateFederalPolicyBrief.pdf" target="_blank">New Leaders, 2014</a>).</li> </ul></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">State procurement rules hamper school-level decision making and stifle innovation</h2><ul> <li>District central offices (which control most school procurement) are notoriously risk-averse.
