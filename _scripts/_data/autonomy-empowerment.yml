According to the 29th Annual MetLife Survey of the American Teacher, principals report that their authority does not match their responsibility&#58;</p><div class="columns"><div class="column is-quarter"><blockquote><strong>89%</strong></br>agree they should be accountable for everything that happens to children in their school.</blockquote></div><div class="column is-quarter"><blockquote><strong>43%</strong></br>have control over removing teachers</blockquote></div><div class="column is-quarter"><blockquote><strong>42%</strong></br>have control over curriculum and instruction</blockquote></div><div class="column is-quarter"><blockquote><strong>42%</strong></br>have control over finance decisions.</blockquote></div></div><p>As the principal role has evolved and become more demanding, states are recognizing that leaders need a wider array of tools and authority to be successful.</p>

    content: <p>In a study of northeast states, the Center on Reinventing Public Education found that <strong>New Hampshire</strong> provided the best policy climate for autonomy and innovation. Compared to their peers in other states, principals in New Hampshire face the fewest barriers to school autonomy, like learning time requirements and other restrictions on funding.</p><p><strong>California</strong> recently revised its school funding scheme by eliminating many categorical restrictions and establishing an accountability system for how funds are spent. Schools now have more funding available for special populations and greater discretion over how to utilize state base funding.</p><p>Principals in <strong>Colorado</strong> and <strong>Tennessee</strong> are empowered to hire teachers based on their fit with the school team and to make other personnel decisions based on the teacher’s performance in the classroom.</p>
