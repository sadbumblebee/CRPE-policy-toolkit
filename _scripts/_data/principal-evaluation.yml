    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Why should states strengthen principal evaluations?</h2><p>Principals are the second most important in-school factor related to student achievement. In fact, one study estimates that highly effective principals raise student achievement by an equivalent of between two and seven months of additional learning each school year compared to the average principal (<a href="http://educationnext.org/school-leaders-matter/" target="_blank">Branch, Hanushek, and Rivkin, 2013</a>).</p><p>Principals are also fundamental to building and retaining great instructional teams. Highly effective teachers are drawn to and thrive under great school leaders (<a href="http://educationnext.org/school-leaders-matter/" target="_blank">Branch, Hanushek, and Rivkin, 2013</a>).</p><p>Just ask any teacher—a great principal can make a world of difference. Given their importance, it’s critical that states support districts in identifying and developing effective school leaders. Rigorous, meaningful evaluations enable district administrators to do just that.</p>

    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">What do rigorous, meaningful principal evaluations look like?</h2><p>Historically, principal evaluations have resembled fulfillment of checklists of various tasks and responsibilities. They are notable for their lack of alignment with identifiable standards and their lack of outcomes-based measures.</p><p>A better model for evaluating principals would be to use multiple measures of principal performance that assess the principal’s impact on school climate and performance, and her ability to develop and lead a team of high-performing educators.</p>

    content: <blockquote>1. Standards-aligned, observation-based assessments by peers and supervisors</blockquote><p>Carefully constructed subjective assessments like observation rubrics and school climate surveys of staff can be reliable indicators of principal performance.</p><blockquote>2. School climate and satisfaction surveys of teachers, students, and parents</blockquote><p>Including an objective measure of school-wide growth in student achievement yields valuable comparison data that, when balanced with other measures contributes to a holistic understanding of a principal’s impact on his or her school. </p><blockquote>3. Objective measures of student/school growth aligned to principal responsibilities</blockquote><blockquote>4. Constructive feedback and development</blockquote><p>No evaluation system is complete without deliberate mechanisms for constructive feedback and development. Even the best school leaders desire frequent opportunities to reflect, learn, and enhance their practice. For struggling principals, these opportunities can provide the critical support they need to improve. </p><p>At minimum, such feedback opportunities should occur after each informal and formal observation. Development systems should be tiered to provide more intensive coaching for those principals who need it, and leverage the knowledge of successful principals as models for their peers.</p>

  - nav: Success Stories
    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Who is doing this well?</h2><p>Several states have adopted policies requiring districts to develop and implement stronger principal evaluations. For a good model law on principal evaluation, policymakers might look to <a href="https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/teaching/statute---act-54.pdf?sfvrsn=2" target="_blank">Louisiana</a>, <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr35.html?section=all" target="_blank">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="https://www.tn.gov/assets/entities/sbe/attachments/5.201_Teacher_and_Principal_Evaluation_Policy_7_24_15.pdf" target="_blank">Tennessee</a>. Each of these states requires regular evaluations that rate principals across multiple tiers of effectiveness, utilize multiple measures of performance, and link to feedback and development.</p><p>While state law should require regular, comprehensive principal evaluations, most states will choose to leave the details of such evaluation systems—like which specific measures to use and their weightings—to districts and schools. Many districts, however, do not have the capacity to develop robust systems, however, and likely will look to the state for guidance. For this reason, states would be wise to develop a model framework that districts can adapt for their own use.</p><strong>Learn more by reading the works of researchers below.</strong>

  - nav: Model Spotlight
    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Model Spotlight</h2><p>Many districts are now using the Vanderbilt Assessment for Leadership in Education (VAL-ED) instrument, created by Vanderbilt University. The VAL-ED evaluation uses a research-based, “learning-centered” design, based on the idea that a principal’s work should be centered on improving learning and ensuring that all of the processes, organization, and in-school structures are in service of supporting teaching and learning. It is aligned to the Interstate School Leader Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) standards. </p><p>VAL-ED works through the use of 360-degree feedback from teachers, principals, and supervisors, focusing specifically on leadership behaviors that relate to increasing student achievement. The behaviors cover six key areas&#58;</p><ul><li>High standards for student learning</li><li>Quality instruction</li><li>Community connections</li><li>Performance accountability</li><li>Culture of learning</li><li>Rigorous curriculum</li></ul><p>Importantly, VAL-ED requires respondents to identify evidence on which they base their assessment. The model also allows for accounting of conditions that may impact how performance is measured (e.g., years in current school, grade levels in school, student body composition, and composition of staff at beginning of appointment). Multiple studies have confirmed that the VAL-ED instrument is rigorous, valid, and reliable. (VAL-ED Technical Manual)</p>

  - nav: Research Review
    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Research Review</h2>Despite the well-established impact of school leaders on student achievement, there is limited research on how specific policies impact principal quality and availability. Generally, efforts to strengthen the evaluation of school leaders are informed by what we know about what effective principals do.

    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Highly effective principals positively impact student achievement.</h2><p>Highly effective principals raise student achievement by an equivalent of between two and seven months of additional learning each school year compared to the average principal. Ineffective principals lower achievement by the same amount (<a href="http://www.educationnext.org/school-leaders-matter/" target="_blank">Branch, Hanushek, and Rivkin, 2013</a>).</p><p>Leadership is second only to classroom instruction in terms of in-school factors that influence student achievement (<a href="http://www.wallacefoundation.org/pages/1_2-shared-leadership-learning-from-leadership.aspx" target="_blank">Seashore Louis, Leithwood, Walhstrom, and Anderson, 2010</a>).</p><p>Impact of a strong leader is more significant in more challenging schools. There is no documented evidence of a troubled school being turned around without intervention by a powerful leader (<a href="http://www.wallacefoundation.org/pages/1_2-shared-leadership-learning-from-leadership.aspx" target="_blank">Seashore Louis, Leithwood, Walhstrom, and Anderson, 2010</a>).</p><p>Effective principals have a positive impact on graduation levels and a substantially larger impact than ineffective leaders on student achievement in reading. The longer an effective principal remains at a school, the greater these effects become (<a href="http://www.economics.ubc.ca/files/2013/05/pdf_paper_david-green-leadership-effects-school-principals.pdf" target="_blank">Coelli and Green, 2012</a>).</p>
