    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Why should states strengthen principal evaluations?</h2><p>Principals are the second-most important in-school factor related to student achievement. In fact, one study estimates that highly effective principals raise student achievement by an equivalent of between two and seven months of additional learning each school year compared to the average principal (<a href="http://educationnext.org/school-leaders-matter/" target="_blank">Branch, Hanushek, and Rivkin, 2013</a>).</p><p>Principals are also fundamental to building and retaining great instructional teams. Highly effective teachers are drawn to and thrive under great school leaders (<a href="http://educationnext.org/school-leaders-matter/" target="_blank">Branch, Hanushek, and Rivkin, 2013</a>).</p><p>Just ask any teacher—a great principal can make a world of difference. Given their importance, it’s critical that states support districts in identifying and developing effective school leaders. Rigorous, meaningful evaluations enable district administrators to do just that.</p>

    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Making Principal Evaluations Rigorous</h2><p>Historically, principal evaluations have resembled fulfillment of checklists of various tasks and responsibilities. They are notable for their lack of alignment with identifiable standards and their lack of outcomes-based measures.</p><p>A better model for evaluating principals would be to use multiple measures of principal performance that assess the principal’s impact on school climate and performance, and her ability to develop and lead a team of high-performing educators.</p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Method</h2><blockquote><strong>1.</strong> Standards-aligned, observation-based assessments by peers and supervisors</blockquote><p>Carefully constructed subjective assessments like observation rubrics and school climate surveys of staff can be reliable indicators of principal performance.</p><blockquote><strong>2.</strong> School climate and satisfaction surveys of teachers, students, and parents</blockquote><p>Including an objective measure of school-wide growth in student achievement yields valuable comparison data that, when balanced with other measures contributes to a holistic understanding of a principal’s impact on his or her school. </p><blockquote><strong>3.</strong> Objective measures of student/school growth aligned to principal responsibilities</blockquote><p>Historically, leadership evaluations have rarely aligned to standards or included outcomes-based measures. When selecting a tool, administrators should pay particular attention to the alignment between the role of the principal being evaluated and the model of leadership assumed by the evaluation instrument.<a href="" target="_blank"></p><blockquote><strong>4.</strong> Constructive feedback and development</blockquote><p>No evaluation system is complete without deliberate mechanisms for constructive feedback and development. Even the best school leaders desire frequent opportunities to reflect, learn, and enhance their practice. For struggling principals, these opportunities can provide the critical support they need to improve. </p><p>At minimum, such feedback opportunities should occur after each informal and formal observation. Development systems should be tiered to provide more intensive coaching for those principals who need it, and leverage the knowledge of successful principals as models for their peers.</p></a>

  - nav: Success Stories
    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Who is doing this well?</h2><p>Several states have adopted policies requiring districts to develop and implement stronger principal evaluations. For a good model law on principal evaluation, policymakers might look to <a href="https://www.louisianabelieves.com/docs/teaching/statute---act-54.pdf?sfvrsn=2" target="_blank">Louisiana</a>, <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/603cmr35.html?section=all" target="_blank">Massachusetts</a>, and <a href="https://www.tn.gov/assets/entities/sbe/attachments/5.201_Teacher_and_Principal_Evaluation_Policy_7_24_15.pdf" target="_blank">Tennessee</a>. Each of these states requires regular evaluations that rate principals across multiple tiers of effectiveness, utilize multiple measures of performance, and link to feedback and development.</p><p>While state law should require regular, comprehensive principal evaluations, most states will choose to leave the details of such evaluation systems—like which specific measures to use and their weightings—to districts and schools. Many districts, however, do not have the capacity to develop robust systems, however, and likely will look to the state for guidance. For this reason, states would be wise to develop a model framework that districts can adapt for their own use.</p>

  - nav: Model Spotlight
    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Model Spotlight</h2><p>Many districts are now using the <a href="http://valed.discoveryeducation.com/" target="_blank">Vanderbilt Assessment for Leadership in Education</a> (VAL-ED) instrument, created by Vanderbilt University. The VAL-ED evaluation uses a research-based, “learning-centered” design, based on the idea that a principal’s work should be centered on improving learning and ensuring that all of the processes, organization, and in-school structures are in service of supporting teaching and learning. It is aligned to the Interstate School Leader Licensure Consortium (ISLLC) standards. </p><p>VAL-ED works through the use of 360-degree feedback from teachers, principals, and supervisors, focusing specifically on leadership behaviors that relate to increasing student achievement. The behaviors cover six key areas&#58;</p><ul><li>High standards for student learning</li><li>Quality instruction</li><li>Community connections</li><li>Performance accountability</li><li>Culture of learning</li><li>Rigorous curriculum</li></ul><p>Importantly, VAL-ED requires respondents to identify evidence on which they base their assessment. The model also allows for accounting of conditions that may impact how performance is measured (e.g., years in current school, grade levels in school, student body composition, and composition of staff at beginning of appointment). Multiple studies have confirmed that the VAL-ED instrument is rigorous, valid, and reliable. (VAL-ED Technical Manual)</p>

Each local school district shall develop and implement a performance evaluation system for elementary and secondary school principals that uses multiple measures aligned with growth in student achievement.</li><li>Consultation with principals. The school principal performance evaluation system shall be developed and implemented in consultation with school principals, including obtaining systematic and continual input from principals, provided that policies, procedures, and performance goals for the performance evaluation system shall not be subject to collective bargaining.</li><li>Evaluation system measures of performance. School principals shall be evaluated using multiple, fair, rigorous, transparent, and valid measures. Evaluation measures shall include, but not be limited to, the following&#58; </li><ol><li>Schoolwide growth in student achievement as measured through state assessments and state-approved, locally designed assessments, consistent with rules issued by the department pursuant to Section 3.</li><li>Schoolwide growth in student achievement for designated subgroups as defined by performance goals determined by the district in consultation with the school principal. </li><li>Multiple additional measures correlated with impacts on student achievement for students in all subgroups, including the principal's ability to attract and retain highly effective teachers, management and development of an effective instructional team, and management of the school including its finances, space, and legal compliance, and </li><li>School climate surveys of school staff and parents. </li></ol><li>Notice of evaluation measures and effectiveness ratings. </li><ol><li>School principals shall be given written notice in advance of the school year of the measures and any specific indicators to be used in their performance evaluation.</li><li>Each school principal shall be rated according to one of at least four levels of effectiveness, designated as "Highly Effective," "Effective," "Needs Improvement," or "Ineffective," defined by the department or local school district, provided that the rating of "Effective" shall be based in significant part on the percentage of students who achieved at least one year's worth of growth for a school year of instruction, or otherwise achieved appropriate growth based on expectations derived from at least two years of individual student achievement data.</li></ol><li>Professional development and feedback. Districts shall design the performance evaluation system to inform and support professional development and opportunities for structured and informal feedback throughout the performance evaluation process. </li></ol><li>Implementation and Use of the Performance Evaluation. </li><ol><li>Full implementation. The department shall issue rules regarding the timeline for development and implementation of the performance evaluation system, including guidelines for piloting the system in advance of full implementation.</li><li>Each district shall fully implement the performance evaluation for school principals pursuant to Section 1 not later than the second full school year following the effective date of this act.</li><li>If a district fails to adopt an evaluation system consistent with the requirements and timelines of this act, or at the election of the district, the district shall use the default evaluation system developed by the department pursuant to Section 3.</li><li>Use of evaluations. </li><ol><li>Districts shall provide targeted support and ongoing feedback and development for school principals based on the measures and results of the performance evaluation, and aligned to the specific needs of the principal and areas of improvement identified by the evaluation and performance goals.</li><li>Districts shall use performance evaluations to inform all personnel decisions regarding school principals; individual decisions regarding retention, compensation and promotion, dismissals, and other staffing decisions including transfers, placements, and preferences in the event of reductions in force, shall be based primarily on results of the performance evaluation.</li><li>Each principal contract and collective bargaining agreement entered into (including option years exercised) after the effective date of this act shall authorize use of evaluation results consistent with this section.</li></ol></ol><li>Responsibilities of the State Department of Education.</li><ol><li>Regulations. The department shall issue regulations governing the development, approval, and implementation of local evaluation systems under Section 1. Such regulations shall be designed to preserve autonomy and flexibility for districts to adopt their own policies and processes for the performance evaluation system, consistent with Section 1.</li><li>Student growth model and value-added system. The department shall develop, implement, and publicly disseminate a statewide student growth model and a value-added system for determining student growth on assessments for the purposes of performance evaluation.</li><li>Technical assistance. The department shall provide technical assistance to districts in developing and implementing a local evaluation system under Section 1, including providing or helping to develop training for evaluators and a resource bank that identifies assessments, processes, tools, and policies that a district may use to develop and implement its evaluation system. </li><li>Default evaluation system. The department shall develop a default performance evaluation system for school principals, consistent with Section 1, that shall be used by districts that are unable to develop their own system or that elect to use the state default system. Districts may customize the default system to reflect local needs and goals, provided the performance evaluation used is consistent with Section 1.</li><li>Longitudinal data system. The department shall ensure that the state’s longitudinal data system incorporates links among individual principal evaluation, data for principal preparation programs in the state, and achievement data for individual students. </li><li>Monitoring. The department shall provide for ongoing monitoring of local evaluation systems established under Section 1 to ensure that evaluation outcomes are consistent in the aggregate with student achievement and growth at the district and school levels, and that the evaluation systems meet the requirements of this act and corresponding implementing regulations issued by the department. The department shall direct corrective actions as appropriate.</li></ol></ol>
