    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Why should states focus on improving school leader retention?</h2><p>Great principals can have a tremendous impact on student and teacher success. But the job of leading a school has become increasingly complex, and surveys of principals indicate that they’re feeling the pressure. Not surprisingly, principal turnover is a significant problem across the country. </p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Principal turnover is a significant problem</h2><blockquote>About <strong>50%</strong> of newly hired <strong>middle school principals</strong> remained at the same school for <strong>three</strong> years.</blockquote><blockquote>Only <strong>30%</strong> of newly hired <strong>high school principals</strong> remained at the same school for <strong>three</strong> years.</blockquote><p>In practical terms, this means the average newly hired high school principal will not see their freshman class graduate high school (<a href="www.shankerinstitute.org/blog/examining-principal-turnover" target="_blank">Fuller, “Examining Principal Turnover,” 2012</a>).</p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Principal turnover has negative consequences, especially for high-need schools</h2><ul><li>High principal turnover can lead to higher teacher turnover and negatively impact student achievement, an acute problem at lower-achieving and high-poverty schools.</li><li>Frequent principal churn—whether from one school to another or out of the profession altogether—undermines efforts to produce sustained school improvements and to implement meaningful reform.</li><li>It takes about three years to see the positive effects of a new principal; progress stalls during transitions between strong leaders.</li><li>Replacing principals, including recruiting and onboarding, is expensive—conservative estimates put the cost at $75,000 each—and it’s not uncommon for large urban districts to replace over 15 principals each year.</li></ul><p>Of course, not all principal turnover is bad; districts should use thoughtful recruitment strategies to replace low-performing principals with high performers. But it’s unlikely that states can improve education for students without ensuring that the best school leaders are retained in the schools that need them the most.</p><h2 class="subtitle is-5">Why do school leaders leave?</h2><p>Although new principals at high-poverty and low-achieving schools often leave for opportunities to lead schools with better conditions, principal turnover occurs for reasons other than the difficulty of the job, such as&#58;</p><ul><li>The role of school leader often comes with substantial on-the-job isolation.</li><li>Local and state policies often limit the principal’s decision-making authority related to personnel and funding.</li><li>Principal compensation is usually tied to experience and education, as well as the size and type of school—but is not based on performance.</li><li>The difference in pay between veteran teachers and school principals does not reflect the increased responsibility and accountability.</li><li>Principals often lack meaningful development, coaching, and advancement opportunities.</li></ul>

    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">What can states do to improve school leader retention?</h2><p>The most powerful policy shifts states can make to improve principal retention involve strengthening school leadership policies overall&#58;</p><ul><li>Providing ongoing evaluation, development, and coaching support.</li><li>Improving principal preparation substantially so that leaders are ready for the rigors of the job.</li><li>Enabling schools to distribute leadership so that principals do not have to carry an ever-increasing load by themselves.</li><li>Empowering principals with the autonomy needed to do the job.</li><li>Collecting and sharing data so that districts and schools can mitigate turnover by planning for succession.</li></ul><p>Compensation also plays an important role, and studies suggest that schools can raise student achievement by attracting higher-performing principals through better pay. States should&#58;</p><ul><li>Encourage districts to link additional principal compensation to increased leadership responsibilities, such as managing other principals, mentoring aspiring principals, and facilitating professional learning communities for rising leaders.</li><li>Establish a statewide model of compensation and salary structure and/or an incentive fund for districts that pilot new salary and award structures based on effectiveness.</li><li>Publicly recognize great principals with measures other than just compensation, such as a principal of the year award, thus communicating that principals are valued improves retention.</li><li>In addition to increased compensation, incentivize highly effective principals to move to high-need schools by providing increased autonomy around decision making, allowing strong leaders to bring their own team, and allocating resources for targeted professional development.</li></ul>

  - nav: Model Spotlight
    content: <h2 class="subtitle is-5">Model spotlight</h2><p><strong>Rhode Island</strong> awarded competitive grants to two districts in 2012 to develop and pilot performance-based compensation models. The Rhode Island Department of Education encourages other districts to learn from and potentially adapt these models through an information warehouse maintained by the department on its website. The website includes emerging local compensation models, useful research, and links to programs and other resources on principal compensation.</p><p><strong>KIPP</strong> invests heavily in leadership development at all levels, including continuous learning opportunities, leader retreats, and one-to-one coaching. While these investments have a substantial cost (approximately $150,000 per principal), KIPP schools see great rewards as well, including significantly better retention rates than the average charter school and nationally recognized impacts on student achievement. This model reflects three key components of improving school leader retention that states could incorporate into their efforts&#58; supporting ongoing development, communities of practice, and one-to-one coaching.</p>

Specifically, after three years, reading achievement in schools with a new, stronger principal increased by four percentile points as compared to student achievement in schools that continued with the same principal. Among middle school students in schools with replacement principals, the gains were larger and statistically significant in both math and reading (<a href="www.mathematica-mpr.com/our-publications-and-findings/projects/impact-of-principal-transitions-in-dc-public-schools" target="_blank">Walsh and Dotter, 2014</a>).</li></ul><li>Principal turnover is expensive.

There is some evidence that strong preparation programs may lead to higher retention later on, though these programs are typically very expensive. Ongoing training serves as a bridge to preparation and provides principals with support and skill development beyond the first two years on the job.</li><li>Establish authentic peer networks that provide space for principals to learn from each other.</li><li>Require ongoing one-on-one coaching support for principals as part of the overall evaluation and development process. Typically, coaching is offered only to first-year principals, but extended coaching could reduce isolation and build leadership capacity.</li><li>Restructure central office supervision and eliminate policies that limit autonomy so principals receive the right balance of support and empowerment.</li></ul><h2 class="subtitle is-5">New Leaders suggests additional state actions for linking compensation and retention (<a href="http://www.newleaders.org/newsreports/publications/state-policy-guide/" target="_blank">New Leaders, 2012</a>)&#58;</h2><ul><li>Encourage districts to link additional principal compensation to increased leadership responsibilities, such as managing other principals, mentoring aspiring principal residents, and hosting or facilitating communities of practice and other professional learning communities for rising leaders.</li><li>Establish a statewide model of compensation and salary structure and/or an incentive fund for districts that pilot new salary and award structures based on effectiveness.</li><li>Publicly recognize great principals with measures other than just compensation, such as a principal of the year award; even small demonstrations communicate that principals are valued, which improves retention.</li><li>In addition to increased compensation, incentivize highly effective principals to move to high-need schools by providing increased decision-making autonomy, allowing strong leaders to bring their own teams, and allocating resources toward targeted professional development.</li></ul>
